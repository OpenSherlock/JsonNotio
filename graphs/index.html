      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">This </font>is the final set 
        of graphs that each submitted tool must process. The graphs have to do 
        with the basic <b>Blocks World</b> domain. Each block has a color and 
        a shape. The blocks can be placed on a table or on top of another block 
        by the use of a hand. When placed on a table or on top of another block, 
        the block now has a location. Each level file is in CGIF format with increasing 
        complexity. Each of these files contain the <a href="../../cgstand/cgstandnmsu.html#Header_44">CGIF</a> 
        format that conforms to the updated standard done by NMSU.<br>
      </p>
      <h3>Level 1</h3>
	  <p>In this level file, <a href="final_graphs_level1.cgf">final_graphs_level1.cgf</a>, 
        is contained basic level graphs with comments that are in a multi-graphs file in the 
        <b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#00D500">CGStream 
        </font></b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#000000">format. 
        There are no extended CGIF syntax, no hierarchies, no lambda expressions, 
        no KB, fully defined types and referents, and contains whitespace for 
        readability. A tool that can parse the basic graphs should be able to 
        parse all of these graphs.</font> 
      <h3>Level 2</h3>
	  In this level file, <a href="final_graphs_level2.cgf">final_graphs_level2.cgf</a>, 
      is contained basic level graphs with comments that are in a multi-graphs file in the <b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#00D500">CGStream 
      </font></b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#000000">format.</font> 
      There are also basic hierarchy graphs and extended CGIF syntax graphs. This 
      file still contains <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#000000">no 
      lambda expressions, no KB, fully defined types and referents, and whitespace 
      for readability.</font> All tools for the CGTools workshop need to be able 
      to read this file. 
      <h3>Level 3</h3>
	  In this level file, <a href="final_graphs_level3.cgf">final_graphs_level3.cgf</a>, 
      is contained a basic Knowledge Base graph with comments. There are hierarchies, lambda 
      expression definitional graphs, catalog of individuals and assertions. This 
      file also contains <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#000000"> 
      fully defined types and referents, and whitespace for readability.</font> 
      A good tool will be able to parse and use this knowledge base. 
      <h3>Level 4</h3>
	  In this level file, <a href="final_graphs_level4.cgf">final_graphs_level4.cgf</a>, 
      is contained a compliant Knowledge Base CGIF graph with comments. Whitespace is present 
      for readablility and comments, but is not necessary. A compliant CGIF tool will be able 
      to use this knowledge base. 
      <h3>Level 5</h3>
	  In this level file, <a href="final_graphs_level5.cgf">final_graphs_level5.cgf</a>, 
      is contained a totally compliant Knowledge Base CGIF format
	  graph. Because there is no whitespaces in it, there are also
	  no comments because comments kind-of need whitespace.  A very 
      good tool will be able to use this file.</td>
